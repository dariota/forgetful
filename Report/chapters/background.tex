This chapter will contain:

\begin{itemize}
	\item background on the patch as applied by Daniel Stenberg
	\item hypothesis as to why the patch caused a performance increase (why that much vs more/less)
	\item background based on similarity to generational GC assumptions (Appel, Shao)
	\item predictions on the results of a generalised application of the patch (vs proebsting's law for compilers)
\end{itemize}
