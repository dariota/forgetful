This chapter will include, for each chosen case study:

\section{Case Study 1}

\subsection{Program Reasoning}

Why choose Case Study 1 to attempt to apply the patch?

\subsection{Predictions}

What results are expected as a result of the patch being applied to Case Study 1?

\subsection{Patch Code}

Either a listing of the patch inlined here, referred to the appendix, or referred to the attached source code or GH\@. Also needs a commitish for the version of the code to apply the patch to.

\subsection{Results}

What were the results before and after the patch? (number of mallocs, performance, speed, power usage if measurable)

\subsection{Comparison to Predictions}

How did the predictions line up? Better/worse?

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Why were the results what they were?
