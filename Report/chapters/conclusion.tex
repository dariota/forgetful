This chapter will include high level summaries and conclusions on:

\section{Results}

Did it match the predictions, if not, hypothesize why not

\section{State of the Plug-in}

What state is the plug-in left in, is there much work to be done, what would be done with more time, what benefits would those changes have/what are the priorities

\section{Benefit of Further Work}

Would further work in this space (not specifically the plug-in) be beneficial? If so, why/what should be done first?
