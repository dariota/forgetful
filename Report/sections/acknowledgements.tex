I would like to thank my friends and family for consistently providing great support throughout the years. In particular, thanks are due to: my parents, for everything they have done to get me to this point; Tiago, for his endless support and thorough inflation of my ego throughout the years; Scarlett, for the myriad ways in which she's provided support and kept me in a healthy lifestyle.

I would also like to thank the various educators and academics who have led me to this goal. In particular I would like to thank David Abrahamson, my supervisor, for his help and guidance throughout this project.

Lastly, thanks are due to the general communities both online and not who nurtured my interests in Computer Science and in programming over the years.
