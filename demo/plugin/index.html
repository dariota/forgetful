		<h1 id="forgetful-plugin">Forgetful Plugin</h1>
		<p>One of the goals of the project was to develop a tool that would detect sites in existing code where a short-lived dynamic allocation could be replaced with a stack allocation. Ideally, a patch would also be generated that could be applied (at or just before compile time, so as to not clutter the code).</p>
		<p>In order to simplify the development of this tool, a static analysis tool to extend needed to be chosen. The <a href="http://frama-c.com">Frama-C</a> platform was chosen for its design which emphasises modularity and extensibility.</p>
		<p>Frama-C and its plugins are written in OCaml, a statically typed language, with type inference, mixing features of imperative, impure functional, and object-oriented programming. Most of the advanced language features are left unused.</p>
		<h2 id="frama-c-platform">Frama-C Platform</h2>
		<p>Frama-C places an emphasis on correctness of the analysis, allowing plugins to annotate the constructed AST with things such as: proof burdens for other plugins to fulfil; metadata about values and expressions; and completed proofs (using Hoare-style weakest precondition computations and standard proof assistants), called properties.</p>
		<p>This system of communication allows plugins to take advantage of information computed by other plugins, and hence the emphasis placed on modularity.</p>
		<p>Frama-C is written in OCaml and unfortunately suffers from a lack of documentation for the usage of its core plugins. Plugin development itself, however, is reasonably well documented.</p>
		<h3 id="evolved-value-analysis-eva">Evolved Value Analysis (EVA)</h3>
		<p>The EVA plugin is of particular interest as it provides ranges or sets of possible values for variables. This can be used to track the result of an allocation through a function and help to determine its lifetime. It also works well in conjunction with the semantic constant folding to capture allocations performed in loops.</p>
		<p>EVA can also be used to determine potential sizes of allocations, though the effectiveness of this analysis is unlikely to be high as code is unlikely to have constraints defined in the source to assist the analysis. Additionally, EVA cannot determine the relative frequency of different allocation sizes as well, meaning that a site could be suggested despite it only performing small allocations a small minority of the time.</p>
		<p>By joining lifetime detection with allocation size prediction, sites of small, transient allocations can be found and highlighted to the user who can then determine whether they're worth changing.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately EVA's API documentation is quite poor which, combined with lack of experience with Frama-C and OCaml, means that a large amount of time was lost and the plugin is as of yet incomplete.</p>
		<h2 id="plugin-development">Plugin Development</h2>
		<p>The core functionality of the plugin is provided by a combination of one of Frama-C's Visitor base classes and the EVA plugin. The visitor classes are (intuitively) classes that use the visitor pattern to callback to user defined code during a traversal of the constructed AST (annotated with anything previous plugins may have added).</p>
		<h3 id="visitor">Visitor</h3>
		<p>In visiting the AST, we're interested only in statements, and in particular in statements containing <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> (in theory, we're interested in any function that leads to dynamic allocation, which could be achieved by tracking any functions that eventually lead to a call to <code>brk</code>, <code>sbrk</code>, or <code>mmap</code>, or even just adding on calloc/realloc, but ultimately tracking these other functions has its own limitations and complications).</p>
		<p>Visiting is performed on a normalised AST, which simplifies the processing code, as only certain limited types of statement need to examined. This allows code containing unusual and/or complex structures allowed in C to be processed as easily as more straightforward code.</p>
		<p>Through Frama-C's documentation, and experimentation with a perfectly reasonable looking C testing file (shown at the bottom of the page), it was determined that <code>malloc</code> only occurred in statements which Frama-C classes as <code>Instr</code>, and in particular only in <code>Call</code> (a reassignment of the form <code>blah = malloc(1)</code> and <code>Local_init</code> (a declaration and initialisation of the form <code>int *blah = malloc(sizeof(int))</code>). <code>free</code> only occurs in <code>Call</code> (in the form <code>free(blah)</code>).</p>
		<h3 id="allocation-tracking-with-eva">Allocation Tracking with EVA</h3>
		<p>Next, some way of tracking an allocated block of memory through the code must be found. Frama-C has a concept of bases, which represent a pointer to the heap (it has no concept of the heap itself). In order to retrieve values from malloc to track through the code, EVA is used. Unfortunately, this is the point where EVA's lack of documentation caused delays. The only API functions referred to are <code>value</code> and <code>eval_expr</code>/<code>eval_lval</code>, but these return values before execution of a statement, not after (which is required to determine the return value of malloc).</p>
		<p>The documentation suggested reading the existing GUI code in order to learn about EVA's API, which led to a large amount of time being lost trying to read fairly complicated and in some cases heavily duplicated code which used an old system to access EVA's API calls in a way which the plugin development guide discouraged in new code.</p>
		<p>Eventually, a solution was found on StackOverflow (as usual!), which allowed retrieval of values after the execution of a statement, encapsulated (as these hard to track down problems often are) in a simple function using EVA's API.</p>
		<p>At this point, the plugin can track what bases a particular <code>free</code> could possibly be freeing, and what bases are created as a result of a <code>malloc</code>. In order to complete the plugin, the value of the expression used in the <code>malloc</code> would have to be found (to determine whether it's a small allocation), and the bases discovered and their locations would have to be persisted (currently, they're just written out) and matched up with the values <code>free</code>d.</p>
		<p>Due to limitations in EVA itself, the plugin can't work on recursive functions.</p>
